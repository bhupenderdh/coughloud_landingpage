Difficulties :-
	>In Wix editor I was not able to upload media from my media
	>It works very slow
	>Once you come to Wix editor leaving Wix ADI you can't go back to Wix ADI.
	>For landing page created with bootstrap I didn't have much time as I have to finish It before 5 pm and I started at 1 pm and also have to learn bootstrap in the mean time.
